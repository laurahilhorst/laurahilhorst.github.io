			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>My name -as you may have guessed- is Laura Hilhorst. I'm an Amsterdam based Information Studies student. These past 8 weeks I've taken a course called Multimedia and Interaction design, during which I have gained some designing skills.This project has sparked my interests in both design and how humans behave online. In the future, I hope to be able to extend my knowledge and skill in this field, a journey of which this website will be my outlet.</p>

			<h3>About this website</h3>
			<p>This website is the final project of my multimedia and interaction design course. On it, you'll find all of the work I've produced in the past eight weeks. The <a href='deliverables.html'>Deliverables</a>-page holds my finished and graded works. The <a href='dump.html'>Dump</a>-section holds all of my preparative work, trains of thoughts and doodles to illustrate my creative processes.</p>
